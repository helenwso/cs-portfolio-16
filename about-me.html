    <div style="   word-wrap: break-word; width:1000px;"> I'm Helen So, a junior at Summit Shasta, and I like cats, aesthetic, and good food.
    I'm an awkward, overly emotional pushover, and I like to stress myself out and self-deprecate, but I also try my best to be a compassionate person, and work hard to contribute to my family and school community.

CATS.

I just really love cats because they're fluffy and lazy and awkward but they act like they know what they're doing.
I also find it hilarious how they can be such jerks (pushing things off tables, "accidentally" shutting off your computer)
but you can catch their attentions and basically get them to go wherever you want as long as you have a portable stick that projects a red dot on the wall.

Yuumei, an artist who describes herself as a disillusioned idealist, has had a really big impact on the things I care about and what I do with them.
I discovered her through my friend around 7 years back, and have really admired her since.
She puts so much work into her beautiful art, draws the most inspirational, creative, and heartfelt things about important topics like divorce, pollution, and government surveillance.
I met her once at Kraken Con and got her autograph in one of her book versions of a flash comic called "thousand words". It was one of the most memorable moments in my life.
Her flash comics and webcomics have inspired me to write my own and found a Comic Club at this school too!

Piano is one of my favorite hobbies! It has had a really big effect on me, as I've been playing for most of my life.
<br> My parents always tell the story of how when I was 6, we were walking through Serramonte shopping center
when I stopped by the front of the Music Center, where someone was playing,
and wouldn't leave because I wanted to learn so much.
A short while later, I walked home from school only to find a beautiful piano sitting in my room.
Ever since, I've been pretty dedicated to piano (with a few ups and downs of course).
In middle school, my enthusiasm decreased, but later in high school, after watching an anime about music called Shigatsu wa Kimi No Uso,
my enthusiasm was revived as I was intent on playing the Chopin that the main character played in the anime.
