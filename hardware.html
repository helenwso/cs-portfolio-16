    <h3>What is a motherboard?</h3>
    <p>A motherboard is a circuit board in a computer that allots power, holds the most crucial components to the computerâ€™s processing
    	(including the CPU, RAM, etc) and allows those components to communicate with one another.
    	Computers of the 1980s allowed for replacement motherboards, which let computers receive upgrades.
    	In later years, more and more crucial components were moved to the motherboard,
    	and in the next decade, motherboards were created that could not be upgraded.
    	Because of their high energy use, they generate a lot of heat, which when not properly dealt with can cause
    	crashing, damage, or other problems. Therefore, most computers nowadays have heat sinks and CPU fans.</p>
