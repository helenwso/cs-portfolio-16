    Hello! Below you'll find the process I took to make my part of the cringey game that Krysten and I call
    <a href="https://klee4017.github.io/Finder/"> Finder. </a><br><br>
    Keep in mind that there are many possible ways to approach this task, whether
    <br>
    content-wise (maybe fewer bad puns?),
    <br>
    aesthetic-wise (fancier styling / different cursor), or
    <br>presentation-wise (keep the phone case but have everything inside be programmed,
    <br>instead of static images designed on Google Slides (Thanks Google Slides)).
    <br><br>For my page in particular, I will go into how I made the first part of the "Sign into Fishbook" worldline,
    <br>If you play through this, keep in mind that this worldline is neither logical neither nor funny until you've already completed the "Delete App" worldline- what Krysten worked on.
   
<br><br><br><br>
<center><img src="images/howto/letsgetstarted.png" alt="Let's Get Started!" width="850px"></center>
<br><br><br>
For this game, our vision was to have visuals on the left, and narrations / choices on the right.
To create this effect, I turned the page into a table.
Everything that would ever go on the left was added in,
but coded so that it wouldn't appear- at first.
(With the exception of the letsgetstarted image, because the Sign Into Fishbook worldline is accessed through an html link, and this is the first image that ever appears)
<br>
I also added an ID to each image to make referring back to it easier later on.
<br><br>
<center><img src="images/howto/col1code.png" alt="Table Code!- Column 1" width="500px"></center>
<br><br>
Next is the more complicated column 2. To make the game work, each part (except the first) also needs to be made invisible,
only to appear when beckoned to by JS. After centering the column and adding a div class to the entire right column for easier usage of CSS,
I created an div with an ID titled "looksingles".<br>
Note: Sorry I can't show the entirety of the code- the pre and code tags aren't working properly, and xmp makes some weird text show up.<br><br>
<center><img src="images/howto/looksingles.png" alt="Look for Singles Code" width="1000px"></center>
<br>
Inside this div, I put the necessary text, and created a button called "Let's get started!".
Within the JS for this button, there is code that
<br>
1) un-displays the "letsgetstarted" div and "looksingles" div, and <br>
2) displays the "mermaid1" image and the next set of text, which was in an ID that I named "istarted".
<br><br>
<center><img src="images/howto/istarted.png" alt="I started" width="850px"></center>
<br><br>
The rest of the code was mostly written with a similar process as described above.
<br>
1) Create divs and name them with IDs <br>
2) Inside the div, type the code for each chunk of text / buttons <br>
3) In the JS for the buttons, where it says onClick=document.getElementById('id_here').style.display=, <br>
put "none" for elements that have already appeared,
and block if the element should be appearing when the button is clicked.
<br><br>
***A special case was the first swipe right button. I didn't give this button any actual purpose, besides to frustrate the player when it doesn't work.
This is because I need to prevent the player from choosing anyone other than the reverse mermaid by the end of the storyline, while giving the illusion of choice.
***
<br><br>
So yeah! That's basically how I made my part of the Finder game. I hope you enjoyed this short spiel on the code and will enjoy the game as well! c:
